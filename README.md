# Geiley Typos

This is a basic implementation of a twitter spell checker that could be the base of automating [geiley typos](https://twitter.com/geileytypos). Automating this would be very easy with a github action, that just runs `python Tweeter.py` every n minutes. The Spellchecker can currently proofread German, English, Spanish, French, Portuguese and Russian.
